# We put our own configuration into .rubocop_cc.yml to let it be overwritten buy .rubocop_todo.yml
# The .rubocop_todo.yml is autogenerated with "rubocop --regenerate-todo" and ignores old errors for new cops
# Then one can, one by one, remove to ignore from the .rubocop_todo.yml file and work on applying new cops also to old codebase.
