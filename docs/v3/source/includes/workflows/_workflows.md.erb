# Workflows

Many users will think of interactions with Cloud Foundry in terms of a single operation like `cf push` in order to upload an application to the platform, have it compiled, and schedule it to be run.
Performing a push operation actually requires a client to orchestrate several requests to the API to accomplish the entire operation.
This section is meant to explain how clients can perform complex workflows using the API.

## Push V2 App and Run a V3 Task

As of CF-245, a V2 Application is also available as a V3 Application, allowing a user to run a V3 Task against it.

1. Push an application: `cf push v3-tasks-sample`
1. Construct a task creation curl: `cf curl /v3/apps/$(cf app v3-tasks-sample --guid)/tasks -X POST -d '{"command":"echo foo; sleep 5; echo bar;"}'`
1. Get logs from task: `cf logs v3-tasks-sample --recent`
1. Check task state: `cf curl /v3/apps/$(cf app v3-tasks-sample --guid)/tasks`
