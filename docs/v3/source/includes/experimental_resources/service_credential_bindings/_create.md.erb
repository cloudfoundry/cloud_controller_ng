This endpoint creates a new service credential binding. Service credential bindings can be of type `app` or `key`; `key` is only
valid for managed service instances.

If failures occur when creating a service credential binding for a managed service instances, the API might execute orphan mitigation steps
accordingly to cases outlined in the [OSBAPI specification](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/spec.md#orphan-mitigation)
