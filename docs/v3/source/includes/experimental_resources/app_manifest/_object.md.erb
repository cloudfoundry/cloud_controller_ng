The app manifest is a method for applying bulk configuration to an app and its underlying processes.
### The app manifest specification

#### App-level configuration
This configuration is specified at the top-level and applies to all of the app's processes.

Field | Description
---- | -----------
**buildpacks**  | Must be an Array. <br>a) An empty array, which will automatically select the appropriate default buildpack according to the coding language. <br>b) An array of one or more URLs pointing to buildpacks. <br>c) An array of one or more installed buildpack names. <br>Replaces the legacy `buildpack` field.
**env** | A key-value hash of environment variables to be used for the app when running.
**no-route** | Boolean value. When set to `true`, any routes specified with the `routes` attribute will be ignored and any existing routes will be removed; ignored if `false`.
**processes** | List of configurations for individual process types. See [_Process-level configuration_](#app-manifest-process-level-configuration).
**random-route** | Boolean value. Creates a random route for the app if `true`; ignored if `false`, if `routes` is specified, if the app already has routes, or if `no-route` is specified.
**routes** | An array of route hashes declaring HTTP and TCP routes to be mapped to the app. Each route is created if it does not already exist. Example route hash entry: `- route: www.example.com/path`
**services** | An array of service-instances to bind to the app. See [_Service-level configuration_](#app-manifest-service-level-configuration).
**sidecars** | An array of configurations for individual sidecars. See [_Sidecar-level configuration_](#app-manifest-sidecar-level-configuration).
**stack** | The root filesystem to use with the buildpack, for example `cflinuxfs2`.
**metadata.labels** _(experimental)_ | [Labels](#labels) applied to the app.
**metadata.annotations** _(experimental)_ | [Annotations](#annotations) applied to the app.
**buildpack**  | **DEPRECATED in favor of the `buildpacks` field above.** <br> a) Blank OR `default` OR `null` will automatically select the appropriate default buildpack according to the coding language. <br>b) A URL pointing to a buildpack. <br>c) Name of an installed buildpack.


#### <a name="app-manifest-process-level-configuration"></a> Process-level configuration
This configuration is for the individual process. Each process is created if it does not already exist.

> **Note:** With the exception of "type", process-level fields can also be provided at the top-level and will apply to the "web" process only. <br/><br/> If there is a process with "type: web" defined in the processes section, then all top level process configuration will be ignored.

Field | Description
---- | -----------
**type** | **(Required)** Process type. The identifier for the processes to be configured.
**command** | The command used to start the process. This overrides start commands from [Procfiles](#procfiles) and buildpacks.
**disk_quota** | The disk limit for all instances of the web process. <br>This attribute requires a unit of measurement: `B`, `K`, `KB`, `M`, `MB`, `G`, `GB`, `T`, or `TB` in upper case or lower case.
**health-check-http-endpoint** | Endpoint called to determine if the app is healthy.
**health-check-invocation-timeout** | The timeout in seconds for individual health check requests for http and port health checks.
**health-check-type** | Type of health check to perform. `none` is deprecated and an alias to `process`.
**instances** | The number of instances to run.
**memory** | The memory limit for all instances of the web process. <br>This attribute requires a unit of measurement: `B`, `K`, `KB`, `M`, `MB`, `G`, `GB`, `T`, or `TB` in upper case or lower case.
**timeout** | Time in seconds at which the health-check will report failure.

####  <a name="app-manifest-service-level-configuration"></a> Service-level configuration
This configuration is _creating_ new service bindings between the app and a service instance. The `services` field can
take either an array of service instance name strings or an array of the following service-level fields.

Field | Description
---- | -----------
**name** | **(Required)** Service instance name.  The name of the service instance to be bound to.
**parameters** | A map of arbitrary key/value pairs to send to the service broker during binding.

#### <a name="app-manifest-sidecar-level-configuration"></a> Sidecar-level configuration
This configuration is for the individual sidecar.  Each sidecar is created if it does not already exist.

Field | Description
---- | -----------
**name** | **(Required)** Sidecar name.  The identifier for the sidecars to be configured.
**command** | The command used to start the sidecar.
**process_types** | List of processes to associate sidecar with.
