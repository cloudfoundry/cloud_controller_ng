### Visibility of Service Offerings

This table shows the Service Offerings that different roles can see.
The Service Offerings that a user can see relate to their Space and Organization roles,
regardless of which Space or Organization is being targeted.

A Service Offering can be seen when at least one of its Service Plans can be seen.
Service Plans may be configured to be Public,
or they may be configured with a relationship to a restricted list of Organizations.

Service Offerings and Service Plans from a space-scoped Service Broker cannot have their visibility configured.
They are only visible to members of that Space.
