This endpoint entitles the specified organizations for the isolation segment.  Only Admins can entitle organizations for isolation segments.
In the case where the specified isolation segment is the system-wide shared segment, and if an organization is not already entitled for any other isolation segment, then the shared isolation segment automatically gets assigned as the  default for that organization.
