This endpoint will synchronously stop and start an application.
Unlike the [start](#start-an-app) and [stop](#stop-an-app) actions,
this endpoint will error if the app is not successfully stopped
in the runtime.

For restarting applications without downtime, see the [deployments](#deployments) resource.
