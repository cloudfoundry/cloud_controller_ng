This endpoint will delete the buildpack cache for a specified app.
The buildpack cache is used during staging by buildpacks as a way to
cache certain resources, e.g. downloaded Ruby gems. A user may want to use this
endpoint when an app doesn't stage anymore due to out-of-disk caused
by a large buildpack cache content.
