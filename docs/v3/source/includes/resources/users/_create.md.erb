### Create a user

Creating a user requires one value, a GUID. This creates a user in the Cloud
Controller database.

Generally, the GUID should match the GUID of an already-created user in the
UAA database, though this is not required.
Creating a user by guid is only permitted by admins.

If CAPI property `cc.allow_user_creation_by_org_manager` is enabled, a UAA user will be automatically created if it does not exist yet.
The UAA user will be only created when `username` and `origin` have been provided instead of a guid. Additionally `origin` must be different from `uaa`.
Admins and OrgManagers can make use of the UAA user creation.
