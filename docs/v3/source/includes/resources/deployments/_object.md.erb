**status.value** | _string_ | The current status of the deployment; valid values are `ACTIVE` (meaning in progress) and `FINALIZED` (meaning finished, either successfully or not)
**status.reason** | _string_ | The reason for the status of the deployment;<br>following list represents valid values:<br>1. If **status.value** is `ACTIVE`<br>- `DEPLOYING`<br>- `PAUSED` (only valid for canary deployments) <br>- `CANCELING`<br>2. If **status.value** is `FINALIZED`<br>- `DEPLOYED`<br>- `CANCELED`<br>- `SUPERSEDED` (another deployment created for app before completion)<br>
**status.details.last_successful_healthcheck** | _[timestamp](#timestamps)_ | Timestamp of the last successful healthcheck
**status.details.last_status_change** | _[timestamp](#timestamps)_ | Timestamp of last change to status.value or status.reason**status.details.last_status_change** | _[timestamp](#timestamps)_ | Timestamp of last change to status.value or status.reason
**status.canary.steps.current** | _integer_ | The current canary step. Only available for deployments with strategy 'canary'. (experimental)
**status.canary.steps.total** | _integer_ |  The total number of canary steps. Only available for deployments with strategy 'canary'. (experimental)
