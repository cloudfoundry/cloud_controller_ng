Get the current user's permissions for the given service instance. If a user can get a service instance then they can 'read' it. Users who can update a service instance can 'manage' it.

This endpoint's primary purpose is to enable third-party service dashboards to determine the permissions of a given Cloud Foundry user that has authenticated with the dashboard via single sign-on (SSO). For more information, see the Cloud Foundry documentation on [Dashboard Single Sign-On](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/dashboard-sso.html).
