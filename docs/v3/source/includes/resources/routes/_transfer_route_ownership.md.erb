### Transfer ownership (experimental)

Transfers a the ownership of a route to a another space.  Users must have write access for both spaces to perform this action.
The original owning space will still retain read and write access to route via [shared spaces](#share-a-route-with-other-spaces-experimental).
To completely remove a space from a route, users will have to use [unshare route](#unshare-a-route-that-was-shared-with-different-space-experimental).
