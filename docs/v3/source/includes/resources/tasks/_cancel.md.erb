<%= yield_content :canceling_task %>
```

Cancels a running task.

Canceled tasks will initially be in state `CANCELING` and will move to state `FAILED` once the cancel request has been processed.

Cancel requests are idempotent and will be processed according to the state of the task when the request is executed.

Canceling a task that is in `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED` state will return an error.
