This endpoint cancels a running task.

Canceled tasks will initially be in state "CANCELING" and will move to state "FAILED" once the cancel request has been processed.

Cancel requests are idempotent and will be processed according to the state of the task when the request is executed.

Canceling a task that is in "SUCCEEDED" or "FAILED" state will return an error.
