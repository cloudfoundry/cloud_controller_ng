This endpoint updates a service broker. Depending on the parameters specified,
the endpoint may respond with a background job, and it may synchronize the
service offerings and service plans with those in the broker's catalog.

When a service broker has a synchronization job in progress, only
updates with `metadata` are permitted until the synchronization job
is complete.
