## Service Brokers

Service brokers manage the lifecycle of services. On behalf of users, Cloud Controller will interact with service brokers to provision, get access to and manage access to the service offerings and plans they offer.

Admins can create and manage service brokers that are globally available, i.e., the service broker and its associated resources (service offerings and plans) can be made available to all users.

Space Developers can create and manage space-scoped service brokers. A space-scoped broker and its associated resources will only be available in the space the service broker was created.
