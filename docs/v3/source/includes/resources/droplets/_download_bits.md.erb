### Download droplet bits

```
Example Request
```

```shell
curl "https://api.example.org/v3/droplets/[guid]/download" \
  -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: bearer [token]" \
```

```
Example Response
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 302 FOUND
Content-Type: application/json
```

Download a gzip compressed tarball file containing a Cloud Foundry compatible
droplet. When using a remote blobstore, such as AWS, the response is a redirect
to the actual location of the bits. If the client is automatically following
redirects, then the OAuth token that was used to communicate with Cloud
Controller will be relayed on the new redirect request. Some blobstores may
reject the request in that case. Clients may need to follow the redirect
without including the OAuth token.

Only droplets that are in the `STAGED` state and have lifecycle type
`buildpack` can be downloaded.
