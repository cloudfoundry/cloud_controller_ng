### Get process instances for a process

This endpoint retrieves the instances for a process. This is a pseudo-resource that provides a lightweight view of process instance states, containing only the `index`, `state`, and `since` fields. Unlike the full [process stats](#get-stats-for-a-process) endpoint, this endpoint is designed for embedding into process resources and provides a minimal representation.
