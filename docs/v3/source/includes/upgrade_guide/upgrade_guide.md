# Upgrade Guide

This document is intended to help client authors upgrade from Cloud Foundry's V2 API to the V3 API.

When moving to the V3 API, it is important to understand that the V3 API is backed by the same data as the V2 API. Though resources may be presented differently and have different interaction patterns, the internal state of CF will be the same across both APIs.

If you have questions, need help, or want to chat about the upgrade process, please reach out to us in [Cloud Foundry Slack](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/messages/C07C04W4Q).

## Conceptual Changes

### App Sub-Resources

The V2 API rolls up several resources into its representation of an "app":

1. **Packages:** Source assets for the application
2. **Droplets:** Staged, executable assets for the application
3. **Builds:** Configuration for how to stage the package into a droplet
4. **Processes:** Configuration for how to run the droplet

The V3 API exposes these resources on the API to provide more visibility and enable more complicated workflows. For example:

1. Staging a previous package into a new droplet
2. Rolling back to a previous droplet
3. Staging a droplet to run a task, without running any processes
4. Running multiple different processes from a single droplet (for example: a web process and a worker process)

Here are some examples of implications for clients:

1. The app resource contains much less information about the application as a whole
2. An application can have multiple processes, each with their own start command, scale, and stats
3. An application might not be running with its most recent package or droplet

### Starting Apps

In the V2 API, starting an app (`PUT /v2/apps/:GUID` with `state`: `STARTED`) will automatically stage new packages into droplets. In V3, [starting an app](#start-an-app) will only run the app's current droplet. This change gives clients more control over what package to stage and when to stage it.

To reproduce the V2 start behavior in V3:

![Start Diagram](start_diagram.png)

1. [List packages](#list-packages) and filter on package state with value `READY` and order by recency.
1. If a package has been turned into a droplet [(see this endpoint)](#list-droplets-for-a-package) this means it has been staged already. In V2 workflows, this would mean this package is what the current droplet is running.
1. Stage the package by [creating a build](#create-a-build). This turns your package into a droplet.
1. Update the app’s [current droplet](#set-current-droplet) to the selected droplet. This droplet will be run when the app starts.
1. Change the app’s state to [started](#start-an-app)

This gives V3 users more flexibility when managing applications. The following
diagram shows many different flows for starting an app.

![Start Flow](start_flows.png)

 Apps can upload multiple packages, stage multiple droplets, roll back to older droplets, and other complicated workflows.


### Asynchronous Operations

Unlike V2, clients cannot opt-in for asynchronous responses from endpoints. Instead, endpoints that require asynchronous processing will return `202 Accepted` with a Location header pointing to the job resource to poll. Endpoints that do not require asynchronous processing will respond synchronously.

For clients that want to report the outcome of an asynchronous operation, the expected pattern is to poll the job in the Location header until its `state` is no longer `PROCESSING`. If the job's `state` is `FAILED`, the `errors` field will contain any errors that occurred during the operation.

An example of an asynchronous endpoint is the [delete app endpoint](#delete-an-app).

Read more about [the job resource](#jobs).

<!-- We need to use plain html here to specify different ids. Otherwise the framework will mess up urls -->
<h3 id="errors-v3">Errors</h3>

```
Example Request
```

```shell
curl "https://api.example.org/v2/apps/not-found" \
  -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: bearer [token]"
```

```
Example Response
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/json

{
   "description": "The app could not be found: not-found",
   "error_code": "CF-AppNotFound",
   "code": 100004
}
```

```
Example Request
```

```shell
curl "https://api.example.org/v3/apps/not-found" \
  -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: bearer [token]"
```

```
Example Response
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/json

{
   "errors": [
      {
         "detail": "App not found",
         "title": "CF-ResourceNotFound",
         "code": 10010
      }
   ]
}
```

The V3 API returns an array of errors instead of a single error like in V2.

Clients may wish to display all returned errors.

### Filtering

```
Filters are specified as individual query parameters in V3
```

```shell
curl "https://api.example.org/v2/apps?q=name+IN+dora,broker;stack:cflinuxfs3" \
  -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: bearer [token]"
```

```shell
curl "https://api.example.org/v3/apps?names=dora,broker&stacks=cflinuxfs3" \
  -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: bearer [token]"
```

Filtering resources no longer uses V2's query syntax. See the example to the right.

A few common filters have been also renamed in V3:

|V2 filter|V3 filter|
|---|---|
|`results-per-page`|`per_page`|
|`page`|`page`|
|`order-by`|`order_by`|
|`order-direction`|N/A<sup>1</sup>|

<sup>1</sup> In V3, order is ascending by default. Prefix the `order_by` value with `-` to make it descending. For example, `?order_by=-name` would order a list of resources by `name` in descending order.

Read more about [filtering in V3](#filtering).

### Including Associated Resources

The `inline-relations-depth` parameter is no longer supported on V3. Instead, some resources support the `include` parameter to selectively include associated resources in the response body.

For example, to include an app's space in the response:
```
cf curl /v3/apps/:guid?include=space
```

Read more about [the `include` parameter](#include).

## New Concepts

### Actions

Actions are API requests that are expected to immediately initiate change within the Cloud Foundry runtime. This is differentiated from requests which update a record but require additional updates, such as restarting an app, to cause changes to a resource to take effect.

Example:
```
POST /v3/apps/:guid/actions/start
```

<!-- We need to use plain html here to specify different ids. Otherwise the framework will mess up urls -->
<h3 id="links-v3">Links</h3>

```
Example Request
```

```shell
curl "https://api.example.org/v3/apps/:guid" \
  -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: bearer [token]"
```

```
Example Response
```

```json
{
  "...": "...",
  "links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "http://api.example.com/v3/apps/:guid"
    },
    "space": {
      "href": "http://api.example.com/v3/spaces/:space_guid"
    }
  }
}
```

Links provide URLs to associated resources, relationships, and actions for a resource.
The example links to both the app itself and the space in which it resides.

<!-- We need to use plain html here to specify different ids. Otherwise the framework will mess up urls -->
<h3 id="metadata-v3">Metadata</h3>

```
Example Request
```

```shell
curl "https://api.example.org/v3/:resource/:guid" \
  -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: bearer [token]"
```

```
Example Response
```

```json
{
  "...": "...",
  "metadata": {
    "labels": {
      "environment": "production",
      "internet-facing": "false"
    },
    "annotations": {
      "contacts": "Bill tel(1111111) email(bill@fixme)"
    }
  }
}
```

Metadata allows you to tag and query certain API resources with information; metadata does not affect the resource's functionality.

For more details and usage examples, see [metadata](#metadata) or [official CF docs](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/adminguide/metadata.html).

Note that metadata consists of two keys, `labels` and `annotations`, each of which consists of key-value pairs. API V3 allows filtering by labels (see [label_selector](#labels-and-selectors)) but not by annotations.

<!-- We need to use plain html here to specify different ids. Otherwise the framework will mess up urls -->
<h3 id="relationships-v3">Relationships</h3>


```
Example Request
```

```shell
curl "https://api.example.org/v3/apps" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: bearer [token]"
  -d '{
        "name": "testapp",
        "relationships": {
         "space": { "data": { "guid": "1234" }}
        }
      }'
```

Relationships represent associations between resources: For example, every space belongs in an organization, and every app belongs in a space. The V3 API can create, read, update, and delete these associations.

In the example request we create an app with a relationship to a specific space.

One can retrieve or update a resource's relationships. For example, to retrieve an app's relationship to its space with the `/v3/apps/:app_guid/relationships/space` endpoint.

For more information, refer to the [relationships](#relationships).

## New Resources

The V3 API introduces new resources that are not available on the V2 API. Below are brief descriptions of these resources. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list and may not be updated as new resources are added to V3.

**Note:** Some of these resources may still be experimental and are subject to change or removal without warning. For up to date information on which resources are still experimental see [Experimental Resources](#experimental-resources).

<!-- We need to use plain html here to specify different ids. Otherwise the framework will mess up urls -->
<h3 id="app-features-v3">App Features</h3>

App features support enabling/disabling behaviors for an individual app.

Read more about the [app feature resource](#app-features).

<!-- We need to use plain html here to specify different ids. Otherwise the framework will mess up urls -->
<h3 id="builds-v3">Builds</h3>

Builds increase the flexibility and granularity of control available
to clients crafting stagings workflows. For example:

- Staging older packages instead of always staging the most recent package
- Staging packages without having to stop an application
- Staging packages to produce droplets without setting them as the current
  droplet for an app
- Staging packages into droplets for use in tasks and/or rolling deployments

Read more about the [builds resource](#builds).

<!-- We need to use plain html here to specify different ids. Otherwise the framework will mess up urls -->
<h3 id="deployments-v3">Deployments</h3>

Deployments are objects that manage updates to applications with zero downtime.

Read more about the [deployments resource](#deployments).

<!-- We need to use plain html here to specify different ids. Otherwise the framework will mess up urls -->
<h3 id="isolation-segments-v3">Isolation Segments</h3>

Isolation segments provide dedicated pools of resources to which apps can be deployed to isolate workloads.

Read more about the [isolation segment resource](#isolation-segments).

### Manifests

Manifests are a method for providing bulk configuration to applications and other resources in a space.

Read more about the [app manifest](#app-manifest) and [space manifest](#space-manifest) resources.

<!-- We need to use plain html here to specify different ids. Otherwise the framework will mess up urls -->
<h3 id="revisions-v3">Revisions</h3>

Revisions represent code and configuration used by an application at a specific time. The most recent revision for a running application represents the code and configuration currently running in Cloud Foundry.

Read more about the [revision resource](#revisions).

<!-- We need to use plain html here to specify different ids. Otherwise the framework will mess up urls -->
<h3 id="sidecars-v3">Sidecars</h3>

Sidecars are additional programs that are run in the same container as a process.

Read more about the [sidecar resource](#sidecars).

<!-- We need to use plain html here to specify different ids. Otherwise the framework will mess up urls -->
<h3 id="tasks-v3">Tasks</h3>

Tasks are one-off jobs that are intended to execute a droplet, stop, and be cleaned up, freeing up resources.

Examples of this include database migrations and running batch jobs.

Read more about the [task resource](#tasks).

## Changed Resources

This table shows how V2 resources map to their respective V3 counterparts. Note that some V2 resources have split into multiple V3 resources, and some V2 resources have been combined into a single resource on V3. As these resources are currently under active development, these mappings may change.

|**V2 Resource(s)**|**V3 Resource(s)**|**Details**|
|---|---|---|
|Apps|Apps, Builds, Droplets, Packages, Processes|
|Buildpacks|Buildpacks|

### Domains in V3

In V2, there were two types of domains exposed via different endpoints: private domains and shared domains.

In V3, there is only one domain resource. A domain is "shared" if it has an "owning organization", which is the organization in which the domain is accessible. This is represented as a relationship to this organization. A domain is "private" if it doesn't have this relationship.

Read more about the [domain resource](#domains).

### Organization Quotas in V3

In V2, `-1` represented an unlimited value for a quota limit.

In V3, `null` is used to represent an unlimited value.

The names of the limit fields have changed from V2 to V3.

|**V2**|**V3**|
|---|---|
non_basic_services_allowed | services.paid_services_allowed
total_services | services.total_service_instances
total_service_keys | services.total_service_keys
total_routes | routes.total_routes
total_reserved_route_ports | routes.total_reserved_ports
total_private_domains | domains.total_domains
memory_limit | apps.total_memory_in_mb
instance_memory_limit | apps.per_process_memory_in_mb
app_instance_limit | apps.total_instances
app_task_limit | apps.per_app_tasks

Read more about the [organization quota resource](#organization-quotas).

### Routes in V3

In V2, the route resource represented a URL that could be mapped to an app, and the route mapping resource represented a mapping between a route and an app.

In V3, these concepts have been collapsed into a single route resource. Now, a route can have one or more "destinations" listed on it. These represent a mapping from the route to a resource that can serve traffic (e.g. a process of an app).

Read more about [routes and destinations](#routes).

### Security Groups in V3

In V2, security groups which apply to _all_ spaces in a Cloud Foundry deployment are termed "default", as in "default for running apps" and "default for staging apps". For example, to apply a default security group to all apps in the running lifecycle, one would `PUT /v2/config/running_security_groups/:guid`

In V3, security groups which apply to _all_ spaces in a Cloud Foundry deployment are termed "global", as in "globally-enabled running apps" and "globally-enabled staging apps." For example, to apply a security group globally to all apps in the running lifecycle, one would `PATCH /v3/security_groups/:guid` with a body specifying the `globally_enabled` key. See [here](#update-a-security-group) for an example.

In V2, on creation, one can specify the spaces to which the security group applies, but not whether it applies globally (by default). To set the group globally to all spaces in the foundation one would `PUT /v2/config/running_security_groups/43e0441d-c9c1-4250-b8d5-7fb624379e02`.

In V3, on creation, one can both specify the spaces to which it applies and also whether it applies globally (to staging and/or running) by specifying the `globally_enabled` key. See [here](#create-a-security-group) for more information.

In V2, the endpoint to apply a security group to a space only includes the lifecycle ("running" or "staging") explicitly when applying to "staging" ("running" is the default lifecycle). For example, to unbind a security group from the running lifecycle, one would `DELETE /v2/security_groups/:guid/spaces/:space_guid`, from the staging lifecycle, `DELETE /v2/security_groups/:guid/staging_spaces/:space_guid`.

In V3, the endpoint to apply a security group to a space includes the lifecycle. For example to unbind a security group from the running lifecycle, one would `DELETE /v3/security_groups/:guid/relationships/running_spaces/:space_guid`.

### Service Brokers in V3

#### Create, Update and Delete


In V3 these endpoints are now asynchronous. See [Asynchronous operations](#asynchronous-operations) and [Service Broker Jobs](#service-broker-jobs) for more information.


### Space Quotas in V3

In V2, `-1` represented an unlimited value for a quota limit.

In V3, `null` is used to represent an unlimited value.

The names of the limit fields have changed from V2 to V3.

|**V2**|**V3**|
|---|---|
non_basic_services_allowed | services.paid_services_allowed
total_services | services.total_service_instances
total_service_keys | services.total_service_keys
total_routes | routes.total_routes
total_reserved_route_ports | routes.total_reserved_ports
memory_limit | apps.total_memory_in_mb
instance_memory_limit | apps.per_process_memory_in_mb
app_instance_limit | apps.total_instances
app_task_limit | apps.per_app_tasks

Read more about the [space quota resource](#space-quotas).

### Users and Roles in V3

The user resource remains largely unchanged from the v2 API. On v2, `GET /v2/users` was restricted to admins, and other users needed to use nested endpoints (`GET /v2/organizations/:guid/user` and `GET /v2/spaces/:guid/user`) to view user resources. On v3, `GET /v3/users` is now available for all users, similar to other resources. Note that this does not change what user resources are visible.

In V2, roles were modeled as associations between organization and space endpoints. In V3, roles have a dedicated resource: `/v3/roles`. This has changed the manner in which roles are assigned. For example, in V2, to assign a user the `org_manager` role, one would `PUT /v2/organizations/:org_guid/managers/:user_id`. In V3, one would `POST /v3/roles` with the role type and relationships to the user and organization.

Read more about [users](#users) and [roles](#roles).

## Deprecated Endpoints

Some endpoints on V2 API do not have direct analogs on the V3 API. This section will cover how to replace these endpoints when migrating to the V3 API.

### Restage

The specialized `/v2/apps/:guid/restage` endpoint is replaced by the [builds](#builds) resource. Builds allow finer-grained
control and increased flexibility when staging packages into droplets. The V3 API avoids making assumptions about which 
package/droplet to use when staging or running an app and thus leaves it up to clients.

#### Replicating Restage

1. Get newest READY package for an app:

	`
	GET /v3/packages?app_guids=:app-guid&order_by=-created_at&states=READY
	`

2. Stage the package:

	`
	POST /v3/build
	`

1. Poll build until the state is `STAGED`:

	`
	GET /v3/builds/build-guid
	`

1. Stop the app:

	`
	POST /v3/apps/:guid/actions/stop
	`

1. Set the app's current droplet to the build's resulting droplet:

	`
	PATCH /v3/apps/:guid/relationships/current_droplet
	`

1. Start app:

	`
	POST /v3/apps/:guid/actions/start
	`

For a zero-downtime restage, you may wish to use [deployments](#deployments) instead of stopping and starting the app.


#### Restage Event

Since the V3 API has no concept of a "restage", the `audit.app.restage` audit
event is no longer reported. Instead, the following events can be tracked:

Audit Event|Description
---|---
audit.build.create | A build is created (staging is initiated)
audit.droplet.create | A droplet is created (staging finishes successfully)
audit.app.stop | Stopping an app is initiated
audit.app.droplet.mapped | A droplet is set as the current droplet for an app
audit.app.start | Starting an app is initiated
audit.app.deployment.create | A deployment is initialized
