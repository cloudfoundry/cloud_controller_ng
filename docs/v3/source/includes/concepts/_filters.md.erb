## Filters

Endpoints which return lists of resources also support filtering the returned resources using query parameters.
The available filter parameters are described in a resource's "list" endpoint in the section "Query parameters".

#### Examples

##### **Single value request**
`GET /v3/apps?names=the_name`

This will return all apps with name `the_name`.

##### **Multiple value request**
`GET /v3/apps?names=first_name,second_name`

This will return all apps with name `the_name` OR `second_name`.

In the case of audit events, multiple timestamps can be requested, which will return all audit
events that occurred at those timestamps. In the following request, all audit events that occurred
New Year's just before midnight and July 4th at noon will be returned:

`GET /v3/audit_events?created_ats=2019-12-31T23:59:59Z,2020-07-04T12:00:00Z`

###### **Exception**
The `label_selector` query parameter will act as AND function, not an OR.

`GET /v3/spaces?label_selector=production,east_coast`

This will return all spaces whose metadata has labels with keys `production` AND `east_coast`.

##### **Combined filters**
`GET /v3/apps?names=the_name&stacks=cflinuxfs3`

This will return all apps with name `the_name` AND stack `cflinuxfs3`.

##### **Empty filters**

An empty filter (`/v3/resources?fields=`) can mean either empty string (`""`) or `NULL`, depending on the resource type.

`GET /v3/buildpacks?stacks=`

This will return all buildpacks with stack `NULL`.

`GET /v3/routes?hosts=hostname1,,hostname2`

This will return all routes with hostname `"hostname1"`, `""` OR `"hostname2"`.

#### Relational Operators (Experimental)

Fields can be filtered using inequality when listing resources. Currently, this is supported only on
the `created_at` field, using the `created_ats` filter.

For example, a response to `/v3/audit_events?created_ats[lt]=2020-06-30T12:34:56Z` will contain
audit events with a `created_at` timestamp strictly earlier than `2020-06-30T12:34:56Z`.

Timestamps must be in [standard timestamp format](#timestamps).

##### Valid inequality operators

**Operator** | **Description**
-------------|-----------------
**lt**       | Return resources strictly less than the given value for the filtered attribute
**lte**      | Return resources less than or equal to the given value for the filtered attribute
**gt**       | Return resources strictly greater than the given value for the filtered attribute
**gte**      | Return resources greater than or equal to the given value for the filtered attribute

##### Resources with inequalities

The following resources can filter using inequality operators:

- **[audit_events](#list-audit-events)**
