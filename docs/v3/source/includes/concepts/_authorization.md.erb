## Authorization

Access to resources is determined by combining scopes in the OAuth 2 token with user roles that are managed by the API.

#### OAuth 2 scopes

Scope | Description
---------- | -------
`cloud_controller.admin` | This scope provides read and write access to all resources
`cloud_controller.admin_read_only` | This scope provides read only access to all resources
`cloud_controller.global_auditor` | This scope provides read only access to all resources except secrets (such as environment variables)
`cloud_controller.read` | This scope provides read access to resources based on user roles
`cloud_controller.write` | This scope provides write access to resources based on user roles
`cloud_controller.update_build_state` | This scope allows its bearer to update the state of a build; currently only used when [updating builds](#update-a-build)

#### Cloud Foundry user roles

Users that interact with the API should have one or more of these roles. Some of them (e.g. admin)
are controlled via scopes on the user's token. Others (e.g. space developer) are controlled via the
[roles resource](#roles).

Role | Description
---------------------------------------------------- | -------
Admin               | Allows a user to manage the platform; OAuth token must contain `cloud_controller.admin` scope
Admin Read-Only     | Allows a user to read all resources on the platform; OAuth token must contain `cloud_controller.admin_read_only` scope
Global Auditor      | Allows a user to read all resources on the platform, excluding sensitive data such as environment variables and service bindings. OAuth token must contain `cloud_controller.global_auditor` scope
Org User            | Allows a user to be assigned other roles within an organization and its spaces
Org Manager         | Provides organization management access
Org Auditor         | Provides read-only access to an organization for auditing purposes
Org Billing Manager | Allows a user to create and manage billing account and payment information
Space Developer     | Allows developers to create and manage apps and services in a space
Space Manager       | Provides space management access
Space Auditor       | Provides read-only access to a space for auditing purposes

#### Component roles

Components that interact with the Cloud Controller in the back-end can be given these roles to allow
limited access to API resources. These roles are controlled via scopes on the component's token.

Role | Description
---- | -----------
Build State Updater | Allows a component to update the state of build resources; OAuth token must contain `cloud_controller.update_build_state` scope
