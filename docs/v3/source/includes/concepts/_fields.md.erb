## Fields

The `fields` parameter allows clients to fetch resources and include information of parent objects in the response.
It works in a similar way to [include](#include), but only displays the fields that were requested.

For example, a response to `/v3/service_instances/:guid?fields[space.organization]=name` will contain detailed
information about the service instance, as well as the name of the organization it belongs to.

Developers may choose to use the `fields` feature to reduce the number of API calls. The fields
query param can be used with a single resource or a list of resources.

The fields query parameter may also grant visibility to parts of resources where the whole resource is not visible.
For instance, the name of an Organization may be retrieved with fields, where the whole Organization resource may
not be visible.

### Fields parameter
The fields parameter is structured as: `fields[resource]=keys&fields[other.resource]=other,keys`

- `resource` is the name of the resource being requested, qualified by the relationship to the current resource.
For example `/v3/service_instances?fields[space]=name` where `space` is a direct relationship of a service instance,
or `/v3/service_instances?fields[space.organization]=name` where `organization` is a relationship of `space`.
- `keys` is a comma-separated list of the fields in the object being requested. For example,
`/v3/service_instances?fields[space]=name,guid` will return just the `name` and `guid` of the space.
