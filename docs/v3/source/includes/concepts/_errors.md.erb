## Errors

```
Example Error
```
```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": 10008,
      "title": "CF-UnprocessableEntity",
      "detail": "something went wrong"
    }
  ]
}
```

An error response will always return a list of error objects. Errors appear on the [job resource](#jobs) for asynchronous operations.

### The error object

Clients should use the `code` and `title` fields for programmatically handling specific errors.
The message in the `detail` field is subject to change over time.

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
**code** | _integer_ | A numeric code for this error
**title** | _string_ | Name of the error
**detail** | _string_ | Detailed description of the error
