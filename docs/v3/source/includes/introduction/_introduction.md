# Introduction

## Overview

Welcome to the Cloud Foundry V3 API docs! Version 3 will add support for several
key features:

* Running one-off tasks on Cloud Foundry
* Applications consisting of several processes via a Procfile
* Direct access to application packages and droplets

## Getting help
The CAPI team can most easily be reached from our [Slack channel](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/messages/capi/) for
questions and issues regarding the API. To report an issue with the docs or API, please feel free to file a GitHub
issue on our API repo, [cloud_controller_ng](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng).

We recommend reaching out to Slack first as the team will be most responsive there.
