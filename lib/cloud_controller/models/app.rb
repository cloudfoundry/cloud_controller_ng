    # many_to_one and one_to_many sides of the relationship ourself.  If there
    # is a sequel option that I couldn't see that provides this behavior, this
    # method could be removed in the future.  Note, the sequel docs explicitly
    # state that the correct way to overide the remove_bla functionality is to
    # do so with the _ prefixed private method like we do here.
