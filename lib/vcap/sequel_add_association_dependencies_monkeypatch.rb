# The AssociationDependencies plugin allows you do easily set up before and/or after
# destroy hooks for destroying, deleting, or nullifying associated model objects.
#
# However, the plugin has no way to return the association dependencies verbatim
# and instead returns its own representation of the dependencies as a hash with keys
# being associations, and values being Proc objects that define an action to be taken
# to implement the defined dependency.
#
# The following monkey patch provides a way to read the defined association dependencies back.
# This is used to provide a generic implementation of soft deletion feature in the App model class.
