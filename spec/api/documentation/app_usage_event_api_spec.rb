        Events are sorted by internal database IDs. This order may differ from created_at.

        Events close to the current time should not be processed because other events may still have open
        transactions that will change their order in the results.

      explanation <<-DOC
        Destroys all existing events. Populates new usage events, one for each started app.
        All populated events will have a created_at value of current time.

        There is the potential race condition if apps are currently being started, stopped, or scaled.

        The seeded usage events will have the same guid as the app.
