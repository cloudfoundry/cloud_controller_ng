multipart-parser is a simple parser for multipart MIME messages, written in Ruby, based on felixge/node-formidable's parser.

Some things to note:

* Pure Ruby

* Event-driven API

* Only supports one level of multipart parsing. Invoke another parser if you need to handle nested messages.

* Does not perform I/O.

* Does not depend on any other library.

Latest release: 0.1.1
  * Fixes some issues with ruby 1.9
